# Telegram Bot Small-Flow Audit — Checklist & Evidence Ledger

Status: ACTIVE — do not treat this file or any isolated green test as whole-bot completion.

## Scope locks

- Audit emitted Telegram buttons through their registered callback/message handlers; verify source, target, state, Back/Home destination, repeat/expiry behavior, and side effects.
- Keep the AutoPost WIP untouched. Do not refactor the shared router or alter stable Product/Edit/SubDub/Voice/Music engine behavior.
- No secrets, production user data, wallet changes, paid provider calls, real customer messages, restart, merge, or deployment without the applicable owner approval.
- Static callback counts are inventory evidence only; a route is complete only after exercising the emitted control through its registered handler.

## Ordered checklist

| ID | Spec / acceptance evidence | State |
|---|---|---|
| A0 | Pin source baseline and enumerate static/dynamic callbacks. Inventory snapshot source: `4f1455ed31c3ebb4acbb6f6d3eff4144bf02185d`; current main: `2099eb319483ba1acc80f1080a094ba9710b5f3d` after PR #1379. Snapshot reports 3,981 button constructors, 83 static handler patterns, 0 unmatched static callbacks, and 821 dynamic callback expressions, all measured on the older snapshot SHA; counts do not prove route correctness and have not been refreshed. | Baseline pinned; dynamic paths still require route evidence. |
| A1 | Admin screens: verify each visible action label matches its handler; test emitted callback, authorization, state transition, and error/stale path. | PARTIAL — report/overview, root/help/package and feedback/access samples have evidence below; S12.13 corrects three Runtime-guide labels without changing their routes; full visible-action matrix remains open. |
| A2 | Admin Back/Home: verify immediate parent and preserve list/filter/page context; test prompt and preview exits without performing the underlying action. | IN PROGRESS — ticket-origin specs S12.6–S12.10 (#1367–#1374) are in #1376; S12.12 merged/deployed in #1378 at runtime SHA `392d2eec`. Other admin/customer routes remain open. |
| A3 | Customer screens: verify ownership, same-product navigation, Back/Home, and no cross-user or cross-product route. | OPEN — audit ledger not complete. |
| A4 | Pending input: verify `/start`, `/menu`, Back, expiry, stale controls, repeated presses, and abandoned drafts clear only the intended state. | PARTIAL — ReplyKeyboard Home preemption PR #1375 is in the deployed #1376 release; the remaining reset/expiry/stale-state matrix is open. |
| A5 | Callback coverage: check static and dynamic emitted values against actual registrations and dispatched terminal behavior; no module-only route test counts as completion. | OPEN — static unmatched count alone is insufficient. |
| A6 | UI/UX consistency: inspect admin/customer button labels, duplicated actions, misleading guide/status labels, row density, and recovery copy; propose or implement only narrow approved fixes. | OPEN — audit ledger not complete. |
| A7 | Final latency diagnosis (last, after route checks): correlate anonymous server phases with a timed user click; separate callback acknowledgement, local build/cleanup, Telegram render, and client/network wait. Report measured distribution and limits; do not guess hardware/network purchases from an uncorrelated sample. | PARTIAL — the 16:57 two-button sequence has measured server timings. After restoring execution under the real Windows account, queries for 18:08–18:15 and 18:40–18:47 +07 returned no matching timing records. The owner did not provide a precise click time; these reports are not additional latency samples. |
| A8 | Closeout: run focused regressions, required syntax/tests, diff/scope review; push a separate PR for each completed spec, merge only in order, and keep deployment/live verification separate. | OPEN. |

## Current evidence

### A1 — Admin operational surface (partial)

- Prior focused evidence: Admin Overview callback and report-source tests passed (one test each); a read-only handler simulation covered monthly/yearly reports, authorization before report read, and invalid period (4 assertions).
- Admin root/help/package evidence: admin root and help tests (2 + 3) and package-storage guide tests (2) passed. Admin feedback/access checks covered emitted destinations, read-only inbox query/no commit, handbook rendering, admin guard, and public denial (6 focused cases); a stale fake helper signature was corrected in the local test fixture.
- Current S12.12 route test exercises the real configured `ADMIN_CONTROL_MODULES` keyboard builders and registered-help callback body; it does not exercise every non-guide admin action or every state-changing handler.
- A1 remains open until each remaining visible admin action has an emitted-button → registered-handler → authorized outcome/error-path evidence row. No provider, wallet, user-data, or production-message operation was performed.

### S12.6 — Admin Ticket reply origin and pagination

- Trigger: Admin Ticket list `high`, offset `6` → ticket detail → `Soạn trả lời` → Back from input or reply preview.
- Root cause: emitted `ticket|reply|<id>` discarded origin; handler hard-coded `source="new"`; pending-state allowlist discarded `list_offset`; preview Back also hard-coded `new`.
- Expected: both Back controls return through `ticket|av|<id>|high|6` to `ticket|al|high|6`; Back must not send the customer reply.
- Local fix: propagate validated source/offset in the Reply callback and pending state, and preserve them in the text preview's Back/Edit controls.
- Evidence before fix: both focused route cases failed at the expected lost-origin assertions.
- Evidence after fix: `python.exe tests/test_support_ticket_reply_origin_pagination.py` → `Ran 2 tests ... OK`; tests dispatch actual emitted controls through the registered ticket handler and assert no send attempt.
- Scope review: the intended patch is `bot.py`, the new focused route test, CI invocation, this checklist, and the tester case. After all edits, the focused unittest reported `Ran 2 tests ... OK`, test-file `py_compile` returned 0, and `git diff --check` returned 0; untracked text files were also checked for trailing whitespace.
- Tester source: `KIEM-THU/DANH-SACH-CASE.md` includes `ADMIN-TICKET-BACK-01`; it requires a seven-ticket fixture/staging list, not production data. Existing tester labels and issue templates were found; no GitHub issue/project was created.
- Delivery state: PR #1367 merged to main on 2026-10-06 as `eba2652bb4ed142bdb4a3daf77099b55bc825cdb`; both required CI checks passed. It was not deployed at its individual merge; it was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376, whose exact runtime SHA is verified below.
- Verification limitation: local `pytest` is unavailable and the earlier full local `py_compile bot.py` run was interrupted after more than six minutes, so it has no local pass/fail verdict. The modified route functions were compiled and exercised by the focused harness, and PR #1367 supplied the missing delivery gates: both `python_hygiene_and_tests` and `python-311-source-compile` passed. No claim is made that the entire repository test suite ran.

### S12.7 — Admin Ticket note origin and pagination

- Trigger: high-priority ticket list `high`, offset `6` → detail → `Ghi chú admin` → Back or submit a note → detail Back.
- Root cause: the note button omitted source/offset; note pending state and prompt Back then defaulted to `new|0`; successful note save also rebuilt detail with the default keyboard.
- Expected: prompt Back returns to the same ticket detail and clears only that pending note; after saving a note, the detail's Back returns to `ticket|al|high|6`.
- RED evidence: three focused tests failed before the fix: emitted callback was `ticket|note|9006` instead of `ticket|note|9006|high|6`; pending data omitted source/offset; saved-note detail linked to `ticket|al|new|0`.
- Minimal fix: carry the validated source/offset in the emitted note callback, pending state, prompt Back, and post-save detail keyboard; legacy callbacks default to `new|0`.
- GREEN evidence: the note-origin tests, existing note stale-guard tests, existing ticket detail pagination test, and S12.6 reply-origin test ran together: `Ran 8 tests ... OK`.
- Scope: `bot.py`, focused regression tests, the CI focused-test command, the tester case, and this ledger. No customer message, provider, wallet, or production data was touched.
- Delivery state: PR #1368 merged to main on 2026-10-06 as `781e23f92e5f169faf2ec7c9cf415d9a0982956a`; both required CI checks passed. It was not deployed at its individual merge; it was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376.

### S12.8 — Admin Ticket ask-customer origin and pagination

- Trigger: high-priority ticket list `high`, offset `6` → detail → `Hỏi thêm khách` → Back at prompt or at preview.
- Root cause: the ask callback omitted source/offset and the handler hard-coded `source="new"`; the existing pending-input/preview path could preserve origin, but it received the wrong default.
- Expected: both Back controls return to the same ticket detail; its list Back returns to `ticket|al|high|6`; pending input is cleared and no customer message is sent.
- RED evidence: three focused tests failed before the fix: emitted callback was `ticket|ask|9006` instead of `ticket|ask|9006|high|6`; pending source was `new` with no offset; preview Back linked to `ticket|av|9006|new|0`.
- Minimal fix: include the validated source/offset in the ask callback, carry them in `admin_reply_input`, and use them in the prompt Back. Existing preview construction already preserves that state.
- GREEN evidence: ask-origin, ask stale-guard, note-origin, note stale-guard, ticket detail pagination, and reply-origin tests ran together: `Ran 13 tests ... OK`. Fake Telegram send spy recorded zero sends during Back paths.
- Scope: `bot.py`, focused regressions, CI invocation, tester case, support runbook, and this ledger. No real customer message, provider, wallet, or production data was touched.
- Delivery state: PR #1370 merged to main on 2026-10-06 as `e954fcaef968a421e8628428d733f99ec7ee275c`; both PR CI gates passed. No deploy workflow ran at that individual merge; it was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376.

### S12.9 — Admin Ticket assignment origin and pagination

- Trigger: high-priority ticket list `high`, offset `6` → ticket detail → `Nhận xử lý` → `Danh sách`.
- Root cause: the Assign button emitted `ticket|assign|<id>` without source/offset; after assignment the handler rebuilt the detail keyboard with its default `new|0` context.
- Expected: Assign updates only the fixture ticket's assignee/status; the refreshed detail's list button remains `ticket|al|high|6`.
- RED evidence: the registered-handler regression expected `ticket|assign|9006|high|6` but got `ticket|assign|9006`.
- Minimal fix: carry validated source/offset in the Assign callback, parse them in the handler with legacy `new|0` fallback, and rebuild the detail keyboard with that context.
- GREEN evidence: ask/assign origin, ask stale-guard, note origin/stale-guard, reply origin, and Admin Ticket Back pagination ran together: `Ran 14 tests ... OK`. Assign is dispatched through the registered ticket handler; no production data or customer message is used.
- Scope: `bot.py`, the generic focused origin test module, CI invocation, tester case, support runbook, and this ledger. No provider call or wallet mutation.
- Delivery state: PR #1371 merged to main on 2026-10-06 as `b3aa82150c570b139dc36047821eb4bbdd04b99d`; both PR checks and main-push CI/source-compile passed. No deploy workflow ran at that individual merge; it was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376.

### S12.10 — Admin Ticket status-change origin and pagination

- Trigger: high-priority ticket list `high`, offset `6` → detail → any status action (`Đã xử lý`, `Đánh dấu refund`, or `Chờ provider`) → `Danh sách`.
- Root cause: all three status callbacks omitted source/offset; after updating status, the handler rebuilt the detail keyboard with the default `new|0` context.
- Expected: all three emitted callbacks carry the current filter/page; a status update changes only the fixture ticket and keeps `ticket|al|high|6` in the refreshed detail.
- RED evidence: the registered-handler test expected `ticket|st|9006|resolved|high|6`, `...|refund_pending|high|6`, and `...|waiting_provider|high|6`; all emitted callbacks omitted `high|6`.
- Minimal fix: append validated source/offset to all three status callbacks; parse them with legacy `new|0` fallback and rebuild the detail with that origin.
- GREEN evidence: status, Assign, Ask, stale-guard, Note, Reply, and Admin Ticket Back regressions ran together: `Ran 15 tests ... OK`. The test dispatches a real emitted status callback through the registered handler using an in-memory ticket fixture.
- Scope: `bot.py`, the existing focused origin regression module/CI command, tester case, support runbook, and this ledger. No production ticket, provider call, customer message, or wallet mutation.
- Delivery state: PR #1372 merged on 2026-10-06; both required checks passed. No deploy ran at that individual merge; it was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376.

### A4 — ReplyKeyboard Home while AutoPost content input is pending

- Trigger: with `awaiting_content_input_type` set, press either `🏠 TOAN AAS MENU` or the legacy `🛸 MENU DỊCH VỤ TOAN AAS` ReplyKeyboard label.
- Root cause: `handle_message` checked those Home labels below the AutoPost pending-content branch, so the Home label could be stored as post content instead of opening `/start`'s menu.
- RED evidence: the baseline handler harness failed on the Home-route assertion while the pending-content state was active.
- Minimal fix: recognize exactly those two labels immediately after slash-state handling and before pending-input handlers; leave the AutoPost content branch unchanged.
- GREEN evidence: `python -m pytest -q --noconftest -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_reply_keyboard_home_route_priority.py` → `3 passed in 1.11s`. Two cases exercise both Home labels and assert the emitted keyboard label plus text-handler registration; the third confirms ordinary pending AutoPost text still follows its existing save-and-draft path. `--noconftest` avoids the unrelated autouse fixture that imports the full `bot.py` module; this test compiles and dispatches the extracted `handle_message` function directly.
- Current-turn verification: shell Python has no `pytest` module, so the same 3 test cases were rerun with the standard-library runner and only the `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator shimmed: `3 focused route cases passed (built-in runner; pytest decorators shimmed)`. `python -m py_compile tests/test_reply_keyboard_home_route_priority.py` and `git diff --check` returned 0.
- Syntax/scope limit: full `py_compile bot.py` previously produced no result after 60 seconds and was interrupted; the focused harness compiles the complete changed `handle_message` function, but no full-file syntax pass is claimed. GitHub source-compile CI remains a required gate.
- Scope: `bot.py`, the focused regression test, tester case, and this ledger. No provider call, Telegram send, job, wallet, production data, or protected engine was touched.
- Boundary: Home now routes correctly, but current `cmd_start` does not clear `awaiting_content_input_type`; therefore later ordinary text still follows the active AutoPost input path. Changing that reset/cancel behavior is outside this approved change.
- Delivery state: PR #1375 merged on 2026-10-06 as `f9e2ea473617409194ad48498beab14b68c2e8dd`; both required CI checks passed. It was later deployed as an ancestor in #1376.

### S12.11 — Anonymous timing coverage for registered callback handlers

- State: PR #1376 merged to main as `27926e15375f9ce7d41bbf37d5fee596c1216fec`; required `python_hygiene_and_tests` and `python-311-source-compile` checks passed. Deploy workflow #37445257742 succeeded; read-only VPS check confirmed `toanaas-bot.service` active/running, `NRestarts=0`, runtime SHA equals the merge SHA. This release also contains merged ancestors #1367–#1375 (including Product Video #1369), so it was not logger-only. Worker sync was disabled because the target diff did not include worker source.
- Trigger/coverage: installer wraps all 87 pre-existing `CallbackQueryHandler` registrations after registration is complete, including the three shared negative-group guards, then adds a final observer. Source review found no `ConversationHandler` and no `CallbackQueryHandler(block=False)` path in this repo. Callback registration patterns and Python handler names are source-defined labels; full callback data is not read for logging.
- Log fields: `prefix`, `handler`, aggregate `guard_ms`, source-named `guard_phases`, `handler_ms`, `render_helper_ms`, `render_helper_calls`, `dispatch_ms`, and coarse `outcome`. `handler_ms` includes nested awaited work; `render_helper_ms` overlaps it and is not an additive phase.
- Privacy: the instrumentation does not log user/chat/message IDs, callback payload, message text, exception details, provider/job IDs, or secrets. Synthetic regression cases verify this for success, guard stop, and handler error.
- RED/GREEN evidence: the first run failed because the instrumentation API was absent; a second RED exposed missing per-guard attribution. Standard-library run with the Codex-bundled Python: `Ran 4 tests in 6.112s — OK`. Full local `py_compile bot.py` produced no output after 60 seconds and was interrupted; no full local syntax pass is claimed. Both GitHub compile and hygiene/tests checks passed for #1376.
- Coverage limit: `render_helper_ms` measures only the shared `safe_edit_query_message` await time; it is not client display/network time and excludes direct Telegram send/edit calls that bypass this helper. `dispatch_ms` is bot-process dispatch from the first guard to the final observer. Existing `callback_latency` records for `menu|main` and `menu|main_video` remain, so those two callbacks will emit a second, separately named `callback_dispatch_timing` record.
- Post-deploy runtime/event gate: satisfied for #1376. The owner confirmed clicking Product Video then Back; anonymous logs contain the expected route sequence, with limits recorded under A7 below. This does not establish client-render timing or all-route smoothness.

### S12.12 — Admin handbook Back returns to its originating module

- Trigger: open an Admin module such as Queue/Freeze or CSKH, press a guide button, then use the guide's Back button.
- Root cause: module guide callbacks omitted their source module (except User/Xu); `handle_admin_help_callback` discarded every parent except `admin_users`; the handbook keyboard therefore fell back to `menu|admin`.
- RED evidence: before the production patch, focused dispatch expected `admin_help|refund|admin_queue` but the Queue button emitted `admin_help|refund`.
- Minimal change: scope only Admin-module `admin_help` callbacks to their module; render a validated Back callback to that module. Legacy/context-free handbook links retain their existing Admin-root Back behavior. No guide text, business action, or product engine changed.
- GREEN evidence: standard-library harness ran `Ran 4 tests ... OK`; it extracts the actual module config and keyboard/handler functions, dispatches every emitted Admin guide callback from all 9 modules, and asserts the Back destination equals the source module. The test also checks registration and non-admin denial. Package-guide tests: `Ran 2 tests ... OK`; three admin-feedback route functions passed via the built-in runner. Changed test files compiled and `git diff --check` returned 0.
- Limits: full-file `py_compile bot.py` was attempted but had no output after about 65 seconds and was interrupted; local full suite/pytest has not been established for this spec. GitHub required CI must pass before merge. No DB mutation, customer message, provider call, wallet operation, deploy, or restart.
- Delivery state: PR #1378 merged as `392d2eec8f942c8e5c1232e5ac537b9a84dfd82c` at `2026-10-06T11:00:27Z`; both required CI gates passed. Deploy run [#37453919573](https://github.com/manhtoangreensky-wq/bot/actions/runs/37453919573) succeeded with that SHA. Read-only VPS check returned `active`, `running`, `NRestarts=0`, and runtime SHA `392d2eec8f942c8e5c1232e5ac537b9a84dfd82c`. No worker sync was requested by the workflow.
- Post-deploy click check: the owner confirmed another click. The read-only journal query covered `2026-10-06 18:08–18:15 +07`; no `callback_dispatch_timing` or `callback_latency route=menu` lines were returned. Without the precise click time and a matching record, this does not prove whether the click reached the callback handler. A7 stays partial.

### S12.13 — Admin Runtime shortcut labels match the guide destination

- Trigger: Admin System, Security/DB, or the legacy Admin System screen → press `Runtime`.
- Source evidence: all three buttons emitted `menu|system_runtime_help`; the registered page spec resolves that action to `system_help_text("runtime")`, a guide page rather than a live status probe.
- RED evidence: an isolated harness executed the actual `menu_nav_keyboard` and `admin_module_keyboard` builders; it found three callbacks labelled `🧬 Runtime`, and the expected guide-label assertion failed.
- Minimal fix: rename those three labels to `📘 Hướng dẫn Runtime`; preserve every callback, handler, guide body, and live runtime command.
- GREEN evidence: the label assertion moved into the existing source-extracted `unittest` fixture and is explicitly executed by CI. Admin handbook/package and ticket-origin regressions ran together: `Ran 24 tests in 25.950s — OK`. The same label case on exact main returned one expected assertion failure. A source comparator proves all `bot.py` differences are exactly the three labels. Full local `py_compile bot.py` previously returned `PY_COMPILE_OK`; changed test files compile successfully.
- Local environment limit: `pytest` is absent. Workflow hygiene ran 99 tests and had 31 failures in Windows Bash fixtures (`bash`/`mkdir`/`dirname` unavailable inside simulated scripts). The deployment workflow, worker-sync script and hygiene test are unchanged; required Ubuntu CI must pass before merge.
- Scope: three labels in `bot.py`, the existing Admin help `unittest`, one CI invocation, tester case and documentation. No runtime action, DB/user-data write, provider call, wallet action, or production message was performed.
- Delivery state: PR [#1379](https://github.com/manhtoangreensky-wq/bot/pull/1379) merged as `2099eb319483ba1acc80f1080a094ba9710b5f3d`. Both CI gates passed; Ubuntu ran 22 Admin route regressions and 99 workflow-hygiene tests successfully. Deploy [#37468134372](https://github.com/manhtoangreensky-wq/bot/actions/runs/37468134372) attempt 2 succeeded. Attempt 1 lost SSH while reading the old SHA, before mutation. Read-only runtime verification confirmed matching SHA, three guide labels, bot/web/nginx active/running with `NRestarts=0`, and HTTP health 200. New-label manual Telegram QA is not claimed.

### S12.14 — Billing shortcuts describe command guides

- Baseline: `2099eb319483ba1acc80f1080a094ba9710b5f3d`; branch `fix/admin-billing-guide-labels-20261006`.
- Scope: seven misleading labels across the module and legacy Billing keyboards. Four destinations (`pending`, `duyet`, `tuchoi`, `payos`) are read-only instructions; the legacy PayOS shortcut also needs the existing module's plan label.
- Acceptance: all eight emitted guide controls dispatch through registered `handle_menu_callback`, show the intended slash-command instructions and Back to Billing; public access is denied before state cleanup. Financial/provider/DB behavior is outside this label patch.
- RED: 3 fixture tests ran; guide dispatch and public-denial tests passed, while the guide-label assertion failed on the actual `📋 Pending` output. Production labels have not yet changed at this evidence point.
- GREEN: seven labels changed across the two keyboards. All 8 emitted controls traverse the registered menu handler, render their command guide and dispatch Back to the actual Billing module. Public access is denied before state cleanup. The focused and Admin/package/ticket regressions ran `27 tests in 32.017s — OK`; test-file compile and `git diff --check` passed. An exact source comparator proves no `bot.py` difference beyond those seven label replacements.
- Delivery: local branch ready for its separate PR. Required CI, merge, deploy and runtime verification remain pending.
- Next route candidate after delivery: Runtime-help Back from Security/DB/System Ops appears to return to the legacy System page. This is source-only evidence; reproduce the real emitted-control/registered-handler path before changing it.

### Final latency spec — partial, server/client split preserved

- Current main/runtime target: `2099eb319483ba1acc80f1080a094ba9710b5f3d` from PR #1379. Deploy run [#37468134372](https://github.com/manhtoangreensky-wq/bot/actions/runs/37468134372) attempt 2 succeeded; read-only VPS verification found all three services active/running with `NRestarts=0` and the matching runtime SHA. The timings below are the earlier historical sample, not fresh measurements of this release.
- After the owner confirmed clicking “Tạo video AI” then “Quay lại”, the anonymous event sequence was `menu|main_video` at `2026-10-06 16:57:18.250 +07`, then `menu|main` at `16:57:20.867 +07`. This is consistent with the two-button round, but there was no exact user click timestamp and the logs contain no identity/callback data, so attribution is not absolute.
- Per-route `callback_latency`: handler `156.054 ms` / `156.930 ms`; acknowledgement `58.973 ms` / `58.998 ms`; awaited `safe_edit_query_message` `76.181 ms` / `79.439 ms`; `render_returned=1` for both.
- `callback_dispatch_timing`: shared guards `35.518 ms` / `33.789 ms`, of which `safe_mode_callback_guard` was `35.405 ms` / `33.724 ms`; total server dispatch `193.403 ms` / `192.631 ms`.
- Supported conclusion: in this sample the server completed dispatch in about 0.19 seconds and the Telegram edit helper returned in about 0.08 seconds. This does not measure Telegram-client display, device rendering, carrier/Wi-Fi, or the end-to-end interval; it cannot identify a remaining network/device cause or justify a hardware purchase.
- Coverage: this is one two-route sequence, not a latency distribution and not evidence for every bot button. Continue gathering route families after A1–A6; then compare several user-timed samples with server phases. Keep A7 PARTIAL until that evidence exists.
- Following later owner click reports, queries covered 18:08–18:15 and 18:40–18:47 +07 and returned no matching timing records. No precise owner-supplied click time exists for these reports; no additional latency conclusion is drawn.
- Access recovery on 2026-10-06: execution under the actual Windows account `martin\\toann` returned GitHub auth exit 0; the SSH identity and pinned ED25519 host key were already accessible. Earlier denied reads under `CodexSandboxOffline` had incorrectly been treated as missing identity/host trust. No ACL, host-key or credential content was changed. Read-only VPS verification at 19:51 +07 confirmed all three services active/running, `NRestarts=0`, and runtime SHA `392d2eec`.
- No provider call, wallet mutation, production-data write, or customer message was made in either audit spec.

## Next execution order

1. S12.11 (#1376) is merged/deployed and its exact runtime SHA is verified; its release scope includes ancestors #1367–#1375.
2. S12.12 (#1378) is merged, deployed, and runtime-SHA verified; no dependent spec starts with an unknown runtime.
3. S12.13 (#1379) is merged, deployed and runtime-SHA verified at `2099eb3`; its 3-label source comparator and CI gates passed.
4. Complete S12.14 Billing-guide labels using the emitted-control/registered menu-handler/Back/public fixture, then deliver its separate PR in the same order.
5. Verify the Runtime-help Back origin candidate in A2, then continue remaining A1 Admin actions and A2 Back/Home/state-origin routes with one narrow RED/GREEN spec at a time.
6. Continue A3/A4/A5 for customer routes, pending-state expiry/stale/repeat behavior, preserving protected product lanes.
7. Finish A6 UI/UX consistency review and update this ledger with evidence, not assumptions.
8. Close A7 only after multiple user-timed samples can be compared to anonymous server phases; separate server, Telegram render and client/network wait.
9. Complete A8 only after every checklist row has evidence and delivery states are separately verified.
